Flex: 
flex-direction : how to column stack in the flex container. -> column, column-reverse, row, row-reverse 

flex-wrap: items should be wrapped for responsive or not -> wrap, no-wrap, wrap-reverse 

flex-flow: combination of direction and wrap 

justify-content: center, flex-start, flex-end, space-around, space-between 

align-item: vertically aligns the container -> center, flex-start, flex-end, stretch, baseline 

align-content: space-between, space-around, center, flex-start, flex-end 

 

just-content : inside containers completely occupies the flex container 

align-content: inside containers doesn't occupies whole flex container 




Float :

. Flot is used to mention where the element should fall 

2. Clear tells no child element which is having float value as clear value is not allowed.  

1st child float value is left. 

2nd child clear value is left. Now 2nd element goes to next line because 1st is already with float. 

 

1st child float is left 

2nd child clear is right 

3rd child float is right. Now 3rd goes to next line and position at right. 

 

 
 Position: 
 
 Static: Static won't be impacted by Top, Bottom, Left, Right. Element always placed as per the DOM position 

Relative: TBLR will have impact on this. But other elements will not have any impact due to this. 

Absolute: Elements will be positioned based its parent (position without static). Other elements will not have impact due of its TBLR 

Fixed: It is same as Relative but the element position is fixed while scrolling. This doesnâ€™t impact other elements position. It overlays on those elements if                       required. 

Sticky: It is combination of relative and fixed.
